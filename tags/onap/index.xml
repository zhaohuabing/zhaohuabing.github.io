      <description>ONAP Beijing is available now! ONAP, as part of LF Networking, now accounts for more than 65% of global subscriber participation through carriers creating a harmonized, de-facto open source platform. While it&amp;rsquo;s so exciting to see that more operators are deploying ONAP in their commercial network, ONAP community realizes that there are still somewhere we can improve to smooth the deployment process. For example, instead of deploying ONAP as a</description>

      <description>Introduction In this session, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the MSB Plan for R2 and Beyond. I&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss the OMSA(ONAP Microservice Architecture): the vision of ONAP Microservice Architecture to support Carrier-Grade requirements of ONAP Microservices, which includes Service Orchestration, Service Discovery, Inter-service Communication, Service Governance and Service Monitoring and External API Gateway. ONAP Architecture Principle: ONAP modules should be designed as microservices: service-based with clear, concise function addressed by each service</description>

      <description>Introduction Microservices Bus(MSB) provide a reliable, resilient and scalable communication and governance infrastructure to support Microservice Architecture including including service registration/discovery, external API gateway, internal API gateway, client SDK. It&amp;rsquo;s a pluggable architecture so it can integrate with auth service provider to provide centralized Authentication &amp;amp; Authorization. MSB also provides a service portal to manage the REST APIs. MSB doesn’t depend on a specific</description>

      <description>Introduction In this session, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the MSB(Microservice BUS) project we have been using in OPEN-O as the fabric for Microservice communications. First, I will start with why we choose Microservice Architecture in OPEN-O. Then, I’d like to talk about the challenges we were facing when we turn to the microservice approach. Finally, How we address these challenges in OPEN-O with the help of Microservice BUS And</description>
